# Music-player

The project is a simple music player developed in Python using the Pygame library and the Tkinter GUI. It allows to load a playlist of MP3 files, play, stop, fast forward and rewind between songs. In addition, it displays the album art of the currently playing song and provides volume controls. The GUI uses Tkinter for layout and buttons, while Pygame handles music playback. The project includes functions to load songs, play them, stop them, change the volume and display the corresponding album art.
